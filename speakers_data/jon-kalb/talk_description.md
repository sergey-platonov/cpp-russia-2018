This talk will cover why engineers looking for performance choose C++. Jon will present an historical perspective of C++ focusing on what's going on in the C++ community right now and where the language and its user base is heading. With a renewed interest in performance for both data centers and mobile devices, and the success of open source software libraries, C++ is back and it is hot. This talk will explain why C++ is most software engineers' go-to language for performance. You will receive a rough historical sketch that puts C++ in perspective and covers its popularity ups and downs.

This talk is based, in part, on the book "C++ Today: The Beast is Back" published by O'Reilly.
