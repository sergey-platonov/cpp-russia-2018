In C++ you can solve a single task in a multiple ways. We will pick an actual task from production, and investigate how it can be solved with a number of tools that C++ provides: STL containers, boost.range, C++20 ranges, coroutines. We will compare API constraints and performance of different solutions, and how they can be easily converted from one to another if the code is well-structured. During the way we explore applications of some useful C++17 features like constexpr if, selection statements with initializer, std::not_fn, etc. Special attention will be payed to my favorite topic - standard algorithms.
